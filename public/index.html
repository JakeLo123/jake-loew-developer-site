            <h3>A rigrous 13 week immersive program that teaches full stack developement</h3>
            <p>After graduating from OU in 2014, I became a music teacher. I enjoyed my career, but deep down I knew I was looking for something else. I learned a little bit of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on a whim and discovered a passion for web development. I decided that I wanted to get deeper into code, so I moved to Chicago to learn attend Fullstack Academy.</p>

                <h3>Bachelor of Science in audio production</h3>
            <p>I have tinkered with audio for as long as I can remember. I made songs and talkshows with a DAT recorder when I was 10 years old. At OU, I honed my production skills engineering sessions for music groups as well as sound for film.</p>
